## Introduction
Pursuing a PhD degree is an important and quite long period. You need to understand it from the very beginning, including:

* What is my target and motivation?
* What is the skill required in the process?
* How do I achieve my targets and handle all the skills?

Here is a blog from Andrej Karpathy who graduated from CS @ standford and now work as director of AI at Tesla.
